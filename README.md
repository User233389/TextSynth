# TextSynth

The UI incorporates the WPF standard Fluent Design System, making it compatible with packaging in MSI and MSIX (APPX)formats while complying with the Windows 11 UI.

This software also uses System.Speech.Synthesis for the text-to-speech function and System.Speech.Recognize for the speech recognition function.
